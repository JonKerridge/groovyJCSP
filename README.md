The groovyJCSP library provides a set of Groovy helper classes that make the use of the JCSP library much easier by reducing the amount of code that has to be written to build parallel systems.<p>


The library uses the @CompileStatic Groovy annotation to improve performance of the library.

These classes are used extensively in the books<p>
"Using Concurrency and Parallelism Effectively parts i & ii"
